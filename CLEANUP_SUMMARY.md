- ✅ Clear separation of concerns between modules

**Code Organization:**
- ✅ Broke down large functions (e.g., `process_llm_response` in main.lua)
- ✅ Created separate functions for tool execution, message processing, and initialization
- ✅ Improved module interfaces and responsibilities

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ Standardized error handling patterns across all modules
- ✅ Comprehensive error wrapping with context information
- ✅ Graceful degradation when non-critical components fail
- ✅ Better recovery mechanisms for API failures

### 4. **Enhanced Build System** (Phase 2 - Architecture)

**Build Script Improvements:**
- ✅ Proper semantic versioning with `version.json`
- ✅ Build manifest generation for tracking
- ✅ Enhanced installer template with version information
- ✅ Separation of build concerns from deployment
- ✅ Support for different version increment types

**New Features:**
- Version management: `major.minor.patch.build`
- Build manifests with file tracking
- Enhanced installer with better error handling
- Environment variable support for CI/CD

### 5. **Security Enhancements** (Phase 1 - Critical)

**API Key Security:**
- ✅ API key masking in all log outputs
- ✅ Provider-specific API key validation
- ✅ Secure configuration storage recommendations

**Input Security:**
- ✅ Comprehensive input sanitization
- ✅ Protection against injection attacks
- ✅ Validation of all user inputs and tool arguments

### 6. **Tool System Improvements** (Phase 2 - Architecture)

**Enhanced Tools:**
- ✅ Added `get_config` tool for configuration management
- ✅ Improved tool argument validation
- ✅ Enhanced tool registration system
- ✅ Better error reporting for tool failures

**Extensibility:**
- ✅ Dynamic tool registration/unregistration
- ✅ Tool listing functionality
- ✅ Plugin-ready architecture foundation

### 7. **Documentation Improvements** (Phase 3 - Quality)

**Updated Documentation:**
- ✅ Comprehensive README with new features
- ✅ Architecture documentation
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Development guidelines
- ✅ Configuration reference

**New Documentation:**
- ✅ PROJECT_CLEANUP_PLAN.md - Detailed improvement roadmap
- ✅ CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md - Implementation summary
- ✅ Inline code documentation improvements

## 🔧 Technical Improvements
